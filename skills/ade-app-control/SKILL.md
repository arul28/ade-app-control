# ADE Electron Control

## Use socket mode

Electron Control is a live desktop drawer service, so every command below uses `--socket` (the general rule is in the **ade-cli-control-plane** skill):

```bash
ade help app-control
ade --socket app-control status --text
ade --socket app-control claim --lane <lane-id> --text
ade --socket app-control launch --command "npm run dev" --text
ade --socket app-control connect --cdp-port <port> --text
```

ADE sets `ADE_APP_CONTROL_CDP_PORT` and `ADE_APP_CONTROL_DEBUG_FLAGS` for launches. Custom Electron launchers should forward one of those values to `--remote-debugging-port`.
`launch`, `connect`, and `claim` all carry lane/session ownership; see "Owning a drawer surface" in the **ade-cli-control-plane** skill for when `claim` is required.

## Inspect

```bash
ade --socket app-control snapshot --text
ade --socket app-control elements --text
ade --socket app-control select --x <x> --y <y> --text
```

Use Inspect mode or `select` to return screenshot-backed DOM, selector, and source context. When the session is owned by a chat or tracked CLI session, ADE can attach the selection to that active Work surface.

## Act

```bash
ade --socket app-control click --x <x> --y <y> --text
ade --socket app-control type --value "text" --text
```

Use Control mode for input. Re-snapshot after meaningful UI changes.

## Logs and terminal

Start with Electron Control status, then prefer Electron Control terminal/log commands:

```bash
ade --socket app-control logs --text --max-bytes 8388608
ade --socket app-control terminal write --data "y\n"
ade --socket app-control terminal signal --signal SIGINT
```

Only fall back to `ade --socket terminal list --text` and `ade --socket terminal read ...` when no Electron Control terminal is active.

## Launching ADE itself from inside ADE

If you are an agent running inside one ADE instance (e.g. ADE Beta or stable) and you need to launch the ADE dev desktop app under Electron Control, the dev launcher is already isolated and safe to run:

```bash
ade --socket app-control launch --command "npm run dev" --text
```

`npm run dev` uses its own runtime socket (`/tmp/ade-runtime-dev.sock`) and a separate Electron profile (`ade-desktop-dev`), so it will not collide with the runtime/socket that is hosting you. Confirm with `ade runtime status --text` before launching — that tells you which socket the CLI is currently attached to.

### Survive Electron restarts

`npm run dev` watches `apps/desktop/src/main/**` and restarts Electron whenever the main bundle rebuilds. After a restart, the Electron Control drawer UI in the parent ADE window can show stale `Waiting for CDP on 127.0.0.1:<port>` even though the new renderer is already exposed on the same port. From the CLI you can confirm and re-bind:

```bash
ade --socket app-control targets --text          # find the new page target id
ade --socket app-control attach-target --target <id> --text
ade --socket app-control snapshot --text         # forces the drawer to repaint
```

If `targets` shows a `/devtools/page/<id>` entry with the dev URL (`http://localhost:5173/...`), CDP is healthy — the drawer banner is just lagging until the next snapshot.
